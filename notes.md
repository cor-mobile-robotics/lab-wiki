1. how to get access
	calendar access: outlook calendar publicly viewable, not editable
			we need a way to see all bookings (see if you are the first booker)
			students ask their supervisors for booking access
			admins can grant access (AMR/R2C staff are admins)
2. lab rules
	safety rules
		--> raise awareness for possible dangers, and how to avoid them
		battery safety (charging)
		ground robots (kill switch for fast robots)
		drone
			how can the drone hurt you and others?
			safety glasses for everyone that is in the cage
			gloves for large propellors
			for large drones/propellors stay away from net
			raise awareness of other people sitting in front of the net
			close curtains to protect student workplaces (people are distracted)
		rope instructions (weights)
	usage rules
		table usage (also document on tables)
		cleaning up tables (cables, hardware)
3. infrastructure
	check AMR wiki if more needs to be moved (where are the robot documentations?)
	mocap cleanup (e.g., calibration instructions) -> Dennis/Saray
	video recording needs documentation -> Thomas makes initial instructions
	network -> Lasse

Ask people to contribute to the wiki if they find out important advice (PhDs edit directly if confident, otherwise or if student/external make pull request)
