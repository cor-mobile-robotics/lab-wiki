# Booking the Lab | The Lab Calendar

>[!important]
> Before using the lab for the first time you *must* complete a [onboarding and safety briefing](https://github.com/cor-mobile-robotics/lab-wiki?tab=readme-ov-file#before-the-first-use).

We aim to minmize the bureaucratic overhead of using the lab. Nonetheless, there are a few rules to coordinate the usage of this valuable resource:

### Booking Rules
- Bookings are on a FIFO basis: each person creating a booking in the calendar should add a "rank" (1st, 2nd, 3rd  etc.) to their booking indicating whether they are 1st, 2nd, 3rd person to make a booking at that time slot. Users with a lower "rank" integer have the right to tell users with a higher rank integer to leave the space if their experiment requires it. This also includes the desks associated with the lab.
  - Please also indicate in the title of your booking which platform you will be using to give others an idea of whether they can run their platform in parallel (e.g., ground robots and drones can often use the space at the same time)
  - If you know in advance that no parallel bookings will be feasible (e.g. because you are recording a video for a publication) then please explicitly indicate that in the title of your booking.
- Users that didn't make a booking in the calendar can still use the lab. However, they have no priority and anyone with a booking may decide to kick them off if needed.

### Viewing the Calendar
- Bookings for the lab can be made via the associated [Calendar](https://outlook.office.com/calendar/MobileRoboticsLab-ME@tudelft.nl/view/week) to the functional mailbox `MobileRoboticsLab-ME@tudelft.nl`.
- Anyone can add a *view* of this calendar as in the outlook web-client by via `click add calendar -> click add from directory -> select your account form the dropdown menu -> enter MobileRoboticsLab-ME@tudelft.nl as "person"`.

### Getting access to the calendar
- Any exisiting member of the functional mailbox can add new users via [this form](https://tudelft.topdesk.net/tas/public/ssp/content/serviceflow?unid=0cae47da8eea48688fbd5e39457b6ba6).
- The first time you request access to the lab, you can also request access to this calendar.
- External members and student can make bookings through their supervisors.

### Creating a booking
