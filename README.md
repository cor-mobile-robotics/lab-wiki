## Before the First Use

Before you use the lab for the first time, please follow these steps:

**Users from outside of LAC/CoR only**
- We welcome everyone to use the system. If you are from outside of LAC/CoR, please first contact [Javier Alonso-Mora](mailto:J.AlonsoMora@tudelft.nl) with your request.
- Upon approval, write an email to the [CoR secretaries](mailto:Secretariaat-cor-me@tudelft.nl) to request access to the lab space with [Javier Alonso-Mora](mailto://J.AlonsoMora@tudelft.nl) in cc.

**Everyone**
- Request an short onboarding session and safety briefing with one of the [lab technicians](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/me/about/departments/cognitive-robotics-cor/people/technical-support) or existing users of the lab (most [PhD's of Javier's group](https://autonomousrobots.nl/people/) and [Laura's group](https://r2clab.com/?page_id=286#group-phd-id) are users).
As part of this email, you may also request access to the lab [calendar](./calendar.md) (requires a TUD netid).
If you do not have booking-rights for the calendar, you must make your bookings through existing lab members. Again, most [members of Javier's group]([https://www.tudelft.nl/en/me/about/departments/cognitive-robotics-cor/people/learning-and-autonomous-control](https://autonomousrobots.nl/people/)), [Laura's group](https://r2clab.com/?page_id=286#group-phd-id) as well as the [CoR Technicians](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/me/about/departments/cognitive-robotics-cor/people/technical-support) can help you with this.
- As part of the initial onboarding session, you will learn:
  - Which [safety considerations](safety.md) to take during experiments.
  - Where to get the keys for the lab equipment.
  - How to book a slot in the [calendar](calendar.md).
